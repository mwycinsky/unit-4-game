    <h1>Whoever is blessed with the task of grading homework today...</h1>

    <p>As per my discussion with Sarah, I have fallen behind in my understanding of JavaScript functions (and subsequently, jQuery), and have decided to spend the time I would be doing this homework assignment on reinforcing my base knowledge on the subject in an effort to put me in a better position moving forward.  As soon as I feel more comfortable with the subject I will revise this assignment.  Sorry, and thanks...</p>
